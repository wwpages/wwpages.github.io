<h3>Scene 1: Three (supposedly) blighted lots</h3>

The first step was Burgis Associates' identifying lots considered blighted by law.  New Jersey law, specifically N.J.S.A. ยง 40A:12A-5, defines eight criteria for blightedness.  Three of the ten Penns Neck lots supposedly met these criteria as follows:

<p/>
<table border="1">
  <tr><th>Lot</th><th>Seizure reason(s) per <a href="/pnd/2019-R191.txt">2019-R191</a></th><th>Notes</th></tr>

  <tr>
    <td nowrap>38.2</td>
    <td>(a) Run-down bldg.<br/>
      (b) Abandoned or or Unusable comm. bldg.
    </td>
    <td>Building <i>falsely cited as condemnable</i> in resolution <a href="/pnd/2019-R191.txt">2019-R191</a> (&para 7), under ยง 40A:12A-5(b) as an abandoned/unusable commercial building, when it is in fact a residential, single-family dwelling.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td nowrap>39.5</td>
    <td>(a) Run-down bldg.<br/>
      (b) Unusable comm. bldg.<br/>
      (d) Unsafe bldg.
    </td>
    <td>Damaged in January 4, 2019 fire, vacated, and sold as-is (fire-damaged) on March 11, 2019 to Vanara Properties, LLC for 2.5x its pre-fire purchase price.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td nowrap>39.27</td>
    <td>(d) Unsafe bldg.</td>
    <td>Despite being deemed a "detriment to safety," the gas station remains <i>open for business today</i>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
</table>

Note that two of these three lots appear to have been deemed blighted, in part, for invalid reasons.  Click
