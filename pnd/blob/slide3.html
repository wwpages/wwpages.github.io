<h3>Scene 3: Extending southward along Route 1, Just for the Hell of It</h3>

Next, the Planning Board, acting unilaterally, on its own <i>without</i> the recommendation of Burgis Associates, decided to apply the "effective redevelopment" rule to include in the area (and so make subject to seizure) Lot 38.1, to the south on Route 1, because "more frontage along Route 1" was <i>necessary</i> to redevelop the blighted area.  This was the next lot to be consumed by The Planning Board Blob.
<p/>
One of the justifications for taking the lot, put forth by Planning Board Member (now Councilwoman) Andrea Mandel, was that if it wasn't included in the redevelopment, someone might want to <i>build a house</i> there:
<blockquote><i>
Ms. Mandel feels that Lot 1 should be in the same redevelopment zone as Lots 2 and 3.  If Lot 1 is left residential, a house could be built on Route One, surrounded by commercial buildings.
  </i>
  <br/>
  &mdash;Planning Board <a href="/pnd/penns_discussion_2019_07_24.txt">minutes</a>, July 24, 2019
</blockquote>  

Of course, this inclusion was not <i>at all</i> necessary to redevelop the area, rather serving only to maximize the profits of the speculator(s) holding the land, and the developer(s) acquiring it.
