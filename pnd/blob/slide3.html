<h3>Scene 3: Extending southward along Route 1, Just for the Hell of It</h3>

Next, the Planning Board, acting unilaterally, on its own <i>without</i> the recommendation of Burgis Associates, decided to apply the "effective redevelopment" rule to seize Lot 38.1, to the south on Route 1, because "more frontage along Route 1" was <i>necessary</i> to redevelop the blighted area.  This was the next lot to be consumed by The Planning Board Blob.
<p/>
Of course, this inclusion was not <i>at all</i> necessary to redevelop the area, rather serving only to maximize the profits of the speculator(s) holding the land, and the developer(s) acquiring it.
