<h3>Chilling Conclusion: The eastward Big Gulp</h3>

Finally, the Planning Board, again acting unilaterally, on its own <i>without</i> the recommendation of Burgis Associates, decided to apply the "effective redevelopment" rule to include (and so make subject to seizure) <i>all four remaining lots</i> to the east of Route 1.  The reason given was that "more comprehensive redevelopment" was <i>necessary</i>.  This was the final, big gulp of land eaten by The Planning Board Blob.
<p/>
Extending the redevelopment area to the second row of lots, doubling it in size, was proposed by Planning Board Member Allen Schectel, acting as nonvoting Alternate I member of the board at the July 24, 2019 meeting:
<blockquote><i>
Mr. Schectel did not feel that the 180-foot depth of Lots 2,3 and 4 was sufficient enough with setback. He thinks that all ten lots should be included in the redevelopment area.
  </i>
  <br/>
  &mdash;Planning Board <a href="/pnd/penns_discussion_2019_07_24.txt">minutes</a>, July 24, 2019
</blockquote>  
<p/>
Of course, this inclusion, too, was not <i>at all</i> necessary to redevelop the area, rather serving only to maximize the profits of the speculator(s) holding the land, and the developer(s) acquiring it.
<p/>
After all possible lots were cited for redevelopment, The Planning Board Blob, having eaten everything there was to eat, now ceased its land-devouring activities.
