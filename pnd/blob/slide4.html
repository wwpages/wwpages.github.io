<h3>Chilling Conclusion: The eastward Big Gulp</h3>

Finally, the Planning Board, again acting unilaterally, on its own <i>without</i> the recommendation of Burgis Associates, decided to apply the "effective redevelopment" rule to seize <i>all four remaining lots</i> to the east of Route 1.  The reason given was that "more comprehensive redevelopment" was <i>necessary</i>.  This was the final, big gulp of land eaten by The Planning Board Blob.
<p/>
Of course, this inclusion, too, was not <i>at all</i> necessary to redevelop the area, rather serving only to maximize the profits of the speculator(s) holding the land, and the developer(s) acquiring it.
<p/>
The Planning Board Blob having eaten everything there was to eat, it ceased its land-devouring activities.
