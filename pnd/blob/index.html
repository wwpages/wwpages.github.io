<h3>An Eminent Domain Slide-show / Horror-show</h3>

On July 24, 2019, the Planning Board of West Windsor, NJ reviewed a
<a href="/pnd/3442.16_Area_in_Need_of_Redevelopment_Study_Draft_Version_1.0_07-03-19.pdf">study</a>
by Burgis Associates of Westwood, NJ,
<a href="/pnd/2019-R090.txt">commissioned</a>
by the Council three months prior, of the southwest corner of historic Penns Neck, a 5.7-acre, ten-lot area of West Windsor immediately east of the Brunswick Pike (U.S. Route 1).  In the course
of commissioning the study, the Township authorized, at the outset, the use of eminent domain power to seize any or all of the area for redevelopment.

<p/>
The study recommended that about half the area (5 of 10 lots) be redeveloped by the Township, citing three lots as blighted by law, and the other two healthy lots included just to connect them together.

<p/>
Ignoring Burgis Associates, the Planning Board, in the July 24 meeting, and with later approval of Council on September 3, became The Planning Board Blob and ate up the whole ten-lot area, recommending <i>all</i> of it be commercialized, effectively and irreparably destroying the unique and historic character of this section of Penns Neck, West Windsor's last living link to its Colonial past.

<p/>
This Slide-Show/Horror-Show explains how The Planning Board Blob Ate Penns Neck, lot by lot.

<p/>
Key to understanding the Planning Board's "logic" is realizing that the process of determining which lots (if any) were "in need of redevelopment" started with and was driven by the assumption that the entire ten-lot area was in need of redevelopment.
