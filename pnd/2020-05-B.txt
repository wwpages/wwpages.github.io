Introduction

On April 15, 2019, the West Windsor Township Council authorized the Township Planning Board to conduct a preliminary investigation to determine if the Penns Neck area along the US Route 1 Corridor between Mather Avenue and Washington Road (hereinafter referred to as the" Study Area") constituted an " area in need of redevelopment" under the New Jersey Local Redevelopment and Housing Law( LRHL). The Planning Board subsequently directed Burgis Associates, Inc. to prepare a planning analysis for the Board' s review and subsequent recommendation to the Township Council.

As identified in the Township Council's authorizing resolution (see Appendix A), the Study Area consisted of ten separate (10) lots which are identified by the Official Tax Map of the Township of West Windsor as Block 38 Lots 1, 2, 3, 25, and 45, and Block 39 Lots 4, 5, 7, 16, and 27. The April 15, 2019 resolution also declared that the preliminary investigation of the Study Area was to be undertaken within the context of a " condemnation" redevelopment procedure. That is, if the Study Area or a portion thereof was determined to be an Area in Need of Redevelopment pursuant to the LRHL, it was to be designated a Condemnation Redevelopment Area. Such a designation would authorize the Township to use all those powers provided by the Legislature for use in a redevelopment area, including eminent domain.

Following a public hearing held on July 24, 2019, the Planning Board ultimately determined and recommended that the entirety of the Study Area constituted an Area in Need of Redevelopment. Subsequently and pursuant to that recommendation, the Township Council adopted Resolution 2019- R191 on September 3, 2019 designating the entirety of the Study Area as Condemnation Redevelopment Area. That same resolution directed the Planning Board to prepare a condemnation redevelopment plan for the aforementioned lots. The Planning Board subsequently directed Burgis Associates, Inc. to prepare such a plan.  Accordingly, the following Route 1 Penn' s Neck Area Redevelopment Plan ( hereinafter referred to as the "Redevelopment Plan" or the "Plan") is the culmination of the Planning Board' s efforts. It has been prepared for the entirety of the Route 1 Penns Neck Business Commercial Redevelopment Area. The Plan set forth herein is designed to affirmatively address the statutory criteria set forth in the LRHL, identify the Plan' s underlying goals and objectives, enumerate permitted uses as well as area and bulk regulations, and indicate its relationship to local, regional, and state land use planning objectives.
