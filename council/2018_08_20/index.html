<h3>Mayor's Comments</h3>

<p/>

<b>MARATHE:</b>

Thanks, so, first, John [Church], let me ask you, answer different questions
you asked.  First about the parking lot, we are still responsible for
groundwater monitoring, and that those levels haven't reached normal,
so until they do, we are, bring it to [indistinct], so that's the
response to your first question.  And your second question about
putting reflectors, we are doing that as we fix the roads.  We are not
doing that, so when that road gets fixed, we will put reflectors on.
We are not ignoring you. So you will never be ignored, so ... On
another note both India and Pakistan celebrated the Independence Day
this week, so happy Independence Day to both countries and people from
those countries.  And tomorrow is [indistinct] one of the Muslim
holidays, so I want to wish everybody who celebrates Eid Mubarak.

<p/>

I really didn't want to comment on the gun issue
last time, but two people who commented disappeared, so I can't respond
to them.  If you make a comment and expect us to respond, at least have
the courtesy to wait and hear the response.  Since, gentleman, you are
here, I will respond to you.  You have every right to come, but you are
better off going to School Board and talking to them.  They are using
your taxes.  They are making the policy decisions.  Our policy decision is
very different than their policy decision.  And once the professional
that I hire to make that decision gives me a recommendation, I don't
feel that model is superior in life to ignore that decision.  So next
time you get mad to me, just tell me what I would tell a parent who is
affected, if, God forbid, something happens to his child, that my model
decision was better than what my hired Police Chief told me, why I
should overrule him.   You give me that nice speech, and then you have
every right to criticize me.  So I am responding to you because you are here.
The two gentlemen didn't have&mdash;the gentleman, lady didn't have the courtesy to wait
and stop.  I understand you're on other side of the issue.  But at some
point you have to decide what the professional is telling you, and what
somebody else is telling you.  It's very fashionable to put&mdash; throw people
under the bus.  The two lawyers who reviewed under&mdash;the agreement are
thrown under the bus repeatedly.  They are not first-year law students
who reviewed this agreement.  They represent the towns in much, much more
heavier matter.  If the impression is being created, as if everybody who
is making the decision is incompetent.  And that is simply not fair.  You
are entitled to your decision.  Everybody else is entitled to their
decision.  And you need to show the same respect to them.  You disagree
with them.  That's perfectly fine.  That's your right.  But the people who
make decisions are not fools and not incompetent.  They may think
differently than you do.  And people who say, "Guns will be introduced in
school," if I have&mdash;I agree that, for agreement, then I'll have to tell
every police officer, "Once you enter the school, put your gun in the car."
Because police have been going in school with guns for last 24 years.
And I will have to tell the Chief, "Leave your gun out.  You cannot enter
the school with a gun."  Thank you.

<h3>Council Members' Comments</h3>


<b>MILLER:</b>

So we are up to Council Member comments.  Virginia?

<p/>

[At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFiIbfLHcz0&t=59m13s">59:13</a> in the video.]

<p/>

<b>MANZARI:</b>

Thank you.  So this past week
we had National Night Out, organized by our wonderful Police Department.
It was a great event as usual.  There are a lot of people out for that.
And our canine unit was out, that's always a big draw for the kids
and the adults. I also went to Sharon Young's retirement party this
past week, and I&mdash;she was our clerk for many years, and I want to
thank her for many years of her service to our town.

<p/>

I did want to
address just a couple of the comments.  I&mdash;you know, I keep hearing people
saying, "Well the majority of the people said 'X,' and you're not listening
to the will of the people."  Thirty people at a Council meeting does not
speak for 30,000 people in the Township.  They may represent what the
majority of the people in the Township want, or they may not.  We don't
know.  And we can't sit up here and make decisions based on who gets the
word out better, and who gets the, you know, the people out better to
come to a Council meeting, and complain, or, you know, say they're
for something, or whatever.  You can't, you can't rule by, you know, mob
rule, whoever happens to show up at the time.  So let's please not say
that the majority of people said "X," for this issue, and for any issue.  It
just doesn't work that way.  Because I've spoken to many people in our
town who are very much for this.

<p/>

And the other thing that I wanted to
address was that I keep hearing, you know, "Oh, they pushed this through
over the summer, and nobody heard about it."  Well I have right here in
front of me a post on Peeps, which has, what, five thousand, ten thousand
people, I don't know anymore.  From March 22nd, at 4:24 p.m..  "The School
Administration is planning to hire police Type Three officers," and then,
you know, "They're going to be retired and carry a gun.  What do people think
about this?"  There are more than a hundred comments under that post. So
to say that nobody knew about it is ridiculous.  That was from March, of
this year.  The School Board's been talking about it for a long time.  If
people didn't hear about, it it's their responsibility to stay, you know,
attuned to what's going on.  And if you have a concern about it,
or a comment, or a complaint, or whatever, then you gotta email your
people on the School Board, or show up at the School Board meetings.  To
ask this body to reverse the decision of another duly
elected body is wrong.  The School Board was elected to make school
policy, and that's what they did.  It's not our job as council to reverse
School Board policy.  We can't do that, and we won't do that.  I just don't
think that's right.  And, so, you know, it bothers me when I hear people
sort of convolute these issues.  You may agree, or you may not agree on
what was decided here when we voted on a contract.  Because that's all
we voted on.  And we had three hours of comments of people talking about
the budget, and how the School Board should spend the budget.  We're not
charge of that budget.  So let's try to, everybody, sort of take a deep
breath, and figure out&mdash;As the mayor had said, if you have concerns about
the schools, the best place to go is to the School Board.   Email them, or
show up in person and talk to them about your concerns.  If you have
problems or concerns about the Township, then come here, and, you know, or
Email us, and share those with us.  That's the best way to get your
grievances heard, or your ideas heard.  And, you know, we, obviously, welcome
everybody speaking.  They spoke for three hours.  So, I just wanted to
thank everybody who came tonight.  I have been coming to the meetings
before I was on Council, like, ten years on and off.  And that's the
way you make change when you get involved in your Township, so thank
you for that.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Thank you.  Jyotika?

<p/>

[At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFiIbfLHcz0&t=1h3m8s">01:03:08</a> in the video.]

<p/>

<b>BAHREE:</b>
Yes, hi, good evening.   National Night Out
was August 7th.  Really fun evening with the volunteer fire companies
and the West Windsor Police Department.  Pretty big crowd, with the people
from our community freely milling with the friendly police officers,
who were handing out pizza slices.   National Drive Electric week is
September 8 to 16, and West Windsor will be hosting an EV event at
the Farmers Market on Saturday September 8th, 10 to 1. The event
is being organized by the West Windsor Environmental Commission, in
collaboration with a few Township residents.   Green energy sources are
here to stay, and these are exciting times with the auto market.
Electric vehicles a very promising future, with declining battery cost
cheaper fuel, lower maintenance costs, and less air pollution, of course.
West Windsor wants to get ahead of the times, and this is a great
opportunity to share information, and learn more about electric
vehicles.  So, hopefully, West Windsor residents will come on&mdash;will come
out, enjoy the electric cars, and pick up some fresh local food and
goods, including food-truck food.

<p/>

There's a possibility of a NJ DEP
grant, as well, for installation of EV chargers in the train station
parking lot, and the Parking Authority will be discussing this in the
near future.  Thank you.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Thank you.  Ayesha?

<p/>

[At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFiIbfLHcz0&t=1h4m28s">01:04:28</a> in the video.]

<p/>

<b>HAMILTON:</b>
So, as a Township matter, I don't
recommend getting your news off of Peeps.  I do, however, recommend you
keep raising this issue to the School&mdash;to the Board of Education.  I
voted against the contract, on the basis of the terms of the contract. I
will oppose the ordinances tonight.  So you don't have to stay.  You know
how everyone else will vote. It's&mdash;It is&mdash;it is a disgrace.  So, any of us&mdash;any of
you who have come up and held us accountable, you're absolutely right
to do so.  And, you know, we may not always agree on votes.  I don't think
you throw out the baby with the bathwater, but this one might be a
deal-breaker for a lot of people. So, you know, I think, you know, I'm
honestly embarrassed that we approved it.  And, you know, I guess we'll
all have to live with that.  Thank you.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Linda?

<p/>

[At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFiIbfLHcz0&t=1h5m32s">01:05:32</a> in the video.]

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
Well, as far as this Class Three officer issue, I've had people come up to me and say that
they're happy that we've done this.  OK, not everybody.  There's some
people that do not want it, and there are some people that do want it.
Some parents want it.  They're okay with it.  There are people who are
teachers or staff members who work in the schools, and perhaps they're
okay with it.  So, it's not like 100 percent of the people don't want
this.  And we have all said, time and time again, go to the School
District.  If they want, you know, go to the School Board.  If they want to
change their minds, for whatever reason, they can.  All's they have to do is
contact both Townships and say, "We're scrapping plans to do this," and
that's it.  That ends it. OK?  So, pay attention.   I've told people over the
years, you got to go to School Board meetings, you got to pay attention.
My opinion: PTAs should have&mdash;every PTA, you have ten schools, ten PTAs&mdash;each one
of them should have a representative there.  OK, whether's a
President, Vice President, someone on the board of the PTA, or just a
member of the PTA.  Because they can't all make every meeting.
They ought to be out there.  That's the way it used to be, when I first moved
here, in 1995.  There were referendums, and there were parents there,
paying attention.  And now ... you're not seeing that as much.  Everybody's
busy.  Very busy with their jobs and everything.  So you have to pay
attention.  There is a public process, and maybe you don't like the
timing and all, but pay attention.  OK.

<p/>

Anyway, I would like if maybe Sam Surtees, or staff to review the, you know, the West Windsor Facilities
Referendum.  Because there are things about numbers of developments that
are coming in.  There's some numbers and statements in here that pertain
specifically to West Windsor.  So, as I'm sure they're going to be
talking this&mdash;about this during the Fall, and maybe we should just
review, and make sure that we're okay with the numbers that are
represented in this.

<p/>

<b>SCHMID:</b>
Did you get that document from online?

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
Yeah ...

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
No, I believe that was handed out to us when we went to dinner at, hosted by the
School Board back in April.

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
No, this one's off the, I think, the web site.

<p/>

<b>SCHMID:</b>
OK, that's all I need ...

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
It wasn't that ...

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
It says May 8th, 2018. I believe I have that.

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
Yeah, well we met
with them the night of the hearing, which was April 25th I'm thinking,
whatever that Tuesday was, for the budget hearing.  That's when they
first, you know, they mentioned all this.  So, anyway, just if Sam or somebody
can look at the numbers in this, because there's some representation, just
want to make sure that ...

<p/>

<b>MARATHE:</b>
I'm sure the School District will hold several hearings once
the school open, regarding the referendum.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Yes, but I think that
Linda is absolutely right, that we want to make sure that whatever they
say is up-to-date and accurate, and I think that the Township should be
the one to review that, rather than their getting it filtered.

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
Yeah.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
So, please, I second Linda's request that it be reviewed in the township, by
whom it's up to you.

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
Also thanks to the police, firefighters, EMS
professionals that did a wonderful job with National Night Out.  I think all
the kids had a lot of fun on the rides and amusements that were
provided.   I'm&mdash;happy Independence Day&mdash;to our, some of our residents,
who grew up in, I guess, India, right?

<p/>

<b>[MEMBER]:</b> And Pakistan.

<p/>

<b>MARATHE:</b> Thank you.

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b> OK.  That's it

<p/>

[At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFiIbfLHcz0&t=1h9m18s">01:09:18</a> in the video.]

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
So, National Night Out was a wonderful opportunity for
children.  I spent it chasing my granddaughter.  There were a lot of
vendors, had very interesting things to say, but anything they had on
display that could be used as a toy, she played with.  And it was a
wonderful experience.   I did not get to say hello to all my colleagues,
because I was busy chasing her.  She's five.  My grandson is 10. I can rely
on him to keep an eye on me.  There's a big difference between five and
ten.  And, anyway it was wonderful. The police did a great job.
Everybody who was there did a great job, and really am looking forward
to next year.

<p/>

I also went to our clerk, Sharon's retirement party.  It was
wonderful.  Great tribute to her for her 16 and a half years as Clerk,
and her job working with everybody, and making sure that we have a
truly great Clerk to follow her in Gay.  So, I think we can feel proud of
that department here in West Windsor.  I also went to fire company BBQ,
held at the West Windsor Fire Company.  I was not able to stay for more
than an hour, but I saw a lot of people going out for snacks and
support.  We have wonderful Volunteer Fire Company, as well, both of them,
as well our paid professionals.

<p/>

And I really have to join some people
in wishing that the School Board had spent some more time on this
issue of the police officers.  It has divided our Township in a painful,
painful way.   I'm sorry to disagree with Virginia, that I think West
Windsor Peeps is not to be relied on for news, even though they are
often accurate.  I am officially on it, but I don't check it all the time.
So, I just hope that this is a lesson to everybody to do better in
communication later.  I did find out&mdash;thank you, Gay&mdash;that the ordinance
that we have up for introduction tonight is not something they have to
do in Plainsboro, because in Plainsboro they don't limit the number of
police officers by ordinance the way we do.  So, unfortunately people
from Plainsboro won't have the opportunity to go to Plainsboro, but
please, please go to the School Board.  And as I said before I was not
comfortable enough with the agreement to be able to vote for it, and I
certainly hope the School Board continues to look into the effect of
their proposal, and assesses it with help from the public, not just in
house, and that this becomes a matter of what's best for our students,
not what's best for anybody's ego.  Nobody likes to be proven wrong.  Nobody
likes to find out, "Oops, I shouldn't have voted that way.  I should have
that way."  But we have to get over that.  And I, too, have spoken to many
people in the Township who are in favor of and who are against the
idea of these police officers in our schools.  So, I will stick with my
vote of last time, because I am not happy with the resolution, the
contract that we approved.  But I really do feel I can see the arguments
on both sides.  And I hope that we can come together and do what's best
for our students in the future, instead of making this a more divisive
issue in our Townships.

<h3>Council Reports</h3>

[At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFiIbfLHcz0&t=1h36m56s">01:36:56</a> in the video.]

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Additional public comment? Seeing none, Council Reports?  Linda?

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
Planning Board is off, the rest of the month so nothing new.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Ayesha?

<p/>

<b>HAMILTON:</b>
Nothing.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Jyotika?

<p/>

<b>BAHREE:</b>
Yeah, Parking
Authority met August 8th, and the WWPA and the Township are in the midst of
a conversation about the in-house ticketing program, and the final
details are being ironed out for a shared service agreement between
the two entities.  And the School Board meets tomorrow.

<p/>

<b>MILLER:</b>
Virginia?

<p/>

<b>MANZARI:</b>
OK .. first I just want to clarify something that I said earlier, for
a couple of my fellow Councilwomen.  I did not say that people should
go to Peeps to get their news.  What I said was, that in March, on Peeps,
somebody posted about the Class Three officers, and that there is a
huge number of people on Peeps that could have seen it, and in fact, over 100
comments were made below that post.  So my point, actually, was that that
issue was publicly discussed, since as early as March, and probably
earlier than that, and that person got that information from a public
School Board meeting.  So that had been discussed since at least March.
That's my point.  Not, "Go to Peeps for your news."  So, please, don't
represent what I said there.

<p/>

I believe we're having a joint Zoning
Board / Council meeting on Thursday, is that on?

<p/>

<b>SCHMID:</b> Yes.

<p/>

<b>MANZARI:</b>

OK.  So that is on
for seven o'clock, here, Thursday evening. And, finally I just wanted to
thank Jyotika for working on the vaping ordinance, and working with
the Health Department, and pushing that on, and you've been putting a
lot of information out there, really educating the public about vaping.
I didn't know a lot about it beforehand, because I'd missed the big
presentation that the School Board had given.  I heard a little bit
about it a couple of years ago, but I really appreciate all the work
that you've done there, so thank you for that.

<p/>

<b>BAHREE:</b>
You're welcome. Thank you.

<p/>

<b>GEEVERS:</b>
Oh, and I had been to that training already, at the Planning Board level,
and signed off on it.
