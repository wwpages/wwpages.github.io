<h2>Resolution 2018-R157</h2>

On the original agenda was
<a href="/doc/2018-R157.pdf">Resolution 2018-R157</a> Urging the Legislature to Amend S-716, S-477 and S-1766.
<p/>
This resolution was intended to voice the Town's opinion that part of the proposed extensions of NJ's statute of
limitations for crimes of sexual molestation should be curbed in scope, in order potentially to save the
Township some money.  It was combined with other, unrelated money-saving measures.  After a public speaker
commented that combining these initiatives together was utterly bizarre, the Resolution was removed from the agenda.
