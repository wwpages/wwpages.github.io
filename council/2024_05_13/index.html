State of Township Address 2024
<br/>
Given at W. Windsor Municipal Center
<br/>
Council Meeting of May 13, 2024

<p/>

Hemant Marathe, Mayor

<p/>

MAYOR MARATHE:

<p/>

<span class="add">He meant, "Mayor is here, because he's always late.  He runs on India time."  So ...</span>

<p/>

Thank you, Council President Geevers and Council Members, for your kind invitation to give my state of the Township address.

<p/>

Every year I wonder what am I going to say in this address that people don't know already. We are fortunate to live in a great community and our Township is in great shape. Like my family, many of you chose to move here. Like me you don't regret your decision. Thankfully many families choose to stay in West Windsor long after their kids graduate from college. I know friends who have paid taxes long after their kids have left, maybe grudgingly, but they love all West Windsor has to offer and appreciate <span class="del">what</span> <span class="add">that</span> this community has given their family. I want to thank every resident for making West Windsor a great community.

<p/>

While talking to people throughout the year I realize that sometimes people don't appreciate the complexity and limitations of the Mayor and Township government. <span class="add">I always say, jokingly, "I wish I was a king."</span>  I will answer some of the common questions I have received over the years.

<p/>

Let me start with the budget - Our <span class="del">Chief Financial Officer</span> <span class="add">CFO</span> John <span class="del">Mauder</span> <span class="add">who</span> will make a budget presentation during the meeting tonight. I am sorry to steal some of his thunder.

<p/>

Tonight, the Council will vote on the 2024 Township budget. I am proud of the transparent and open process the Mayor and Council uses to review the budget, which is how we strive to do everything every day. The Council held open budget hearings for over 9 hours over three days to go over the budget before it was even introduced. Every citizen had an opportunity to comment and give suggestions. Both Mayor and Council heard the public's desire for more lighting and pedestrian safety. As a result, the Council increased the budget in those areas even above and beyond the increases proposed by the Administration.

<p/>

The Township has two caps on the budget. Most people are aware of the 2% cap on tax increases which means that the total taxes raised by the Township <span class="del">can't</span> <span class="add">cannot</span> increase more than 2% compared to last year.  <span class="add">Doesn't mean your taxes necessarily will increase more than 2%, but the total taxes that we collect.</span>  This year tax our levy is increasing by 1.44% well under the cap.  The less understood cap is the cap on total operational expenditures which <span class="add">in this year</span> is <span class="del">a</span> total of 3.5% which includes an additional 1% that the Council will vote on tonight. That means the Township can't spend more than 3.5% than what we spent last year. We are making full use of <span class="del">this</span> <span class="add">that</span> 3.5% cap. This increase has to take care of the high inflationary price increases we have seen across the board as well as <span class="add">the</span> new state mandates and maintenance of infrastructure. A number of people <span class="del">say</span> <span class="add">have privately told me</span> that they are willing to pay higher taxes for a particular service.  Some examples are increased maintenance <span class="del">and</span> amenities for roads and public spaces as well as <span class="add">some</span> brand new items <span class="del">such as</span> <span class="add">like</span> additional street lights <span class="del">or</span> <span class="add">and</span> flashing beacons at pedestrian crossings. Since we have maxed out the expenditure cap any increase in one area has to match dollar for dollar a decrease in <span class="del">another</span> <span class="add">some other</span> area.

<p/>

I often hear about high taxes paid by <span class="del">the</span> residents and the implication being we should be able to provide <span class="del">more services</span> <span class="add">any service that the person desires</span>. I want to point out that although municipal government does collect your property taxes about 85% are passed through to the County and <span class="add">the</span> School District. An average household in West Windsor pays only $2,246 in annual municipal taxes or about $187 per month. That is all the Township gets to keep.  In return you get all services provided by the municipal government -- Police, fire, garbage and recycle pickup, snow removal, brush & leaf pickup, Health Department and Senior Center services, roads, street lights, sidewalks, street trees and parks. I am <span class="del">sure</span> <span class="add">certain</span> I missed a few things <span class="del">in</span> <span class="add">on</span> the list. Just to reiterate all <span class="del">that</span> <span class="add">those services</span> for <span class="add">just</span> $187/month. <span class="add">Compare that to your phone bill, or your cable bill, or your homeowners association dues, and you will realize how good a deal it is.</span>  By every measure the taxpayers are getting full bang for their tax dollars from the municipal government.

<p/>

John will cover the budget in detail in his presentation. I would like to highlight some of the increases in the budget based on community <span class="del">requests</span> <span class="add">input</span>.

<p/>

We are hiring two new Police officers this year. <span class="add"><i>(Gesturing to audience ...)</i> He will still say, "It's not enough," ... see, he's nodding his head.</span>   Residents repeatedly point out issues such as cars not stopping at cross walks, blowing past stopped school buses or in general speeding. Our Police do <span class="add">a</span> daily enforcement and write their <span class="add">own</span> share of tickets.  Hiring <span class="del">of</span> two new officers will help us increase enforcement. However, Police can't be there at <span class="del">all places</span> <span class="add">every location</span> <span class="del">all the</span> <span class="add">at every</span> time.

<p/>

At my request, for one week, the <span class="add">West Windsor</span> Police kept track of sources of tickets <span class="del">written</span> they wrote during that week. On internal roads <span class="add">not counting Route One</span>, between 60-70% tickets <span class="add">on every road</span> were issued to West Windsor residents. <span class="del">It's</span> <span class="add">That's</span> our friends, neighbors and in some case ourselves who are responsible for traffic issues.  The Police will continue to do their job. <span class="add">But</span> A permanent and <span class="add">a</span> long-term solution is for each of us to be cognizant of our <span class="add">own</span> driving <span class="add">habits</span>.

<p/>

In light of the <span class="del">traffic</span> <span class="add">unfortunate</span> accident last year on Rabbit Hill Road residents have asked for more street lighting, cross walks with flashing beacons and new sidewalks at various locations.  <span class="add">Let me address all three requests.</span>

<p/>

As I have pointed out in the past street lighting is an expensive <span class="add">annual</span> item. Last year the Township paid <span class="del">about</span> $415,000 to JCP&L and PSE&G for street lighting. This is an annual expense out of operating budget. This year after Council requested an increase above <span class="add">and beyond</span> what the administration had already proposed we have budgeted $450,000. We have not finalized all locations but can confirm the following <span class="add">locations</span>:

<ul>

<li>Rabbit Hill Road, including intersections with Cranbury Road, <span class="del">Route</span> 571 and all side streets; <span class="del">replace</span> <span class="add">will be replacing</span> 6 existing light fixtures <span class="add">with brighter lights</span> and <span class="del">install</span> <span class="add">installing</span> 8 new lights;

<li>Bennington Drive; <span class="add">will</span> upgrade 4 existing street lights;

<li>Cranbury Road in the area of the new sidewalk and crosswalks; 5 new street lights and 1 <span class="del">street light</span> upgrade

<li>North Post Road <span class="del">existing curve</span>; 2 new street lights

<li>Conover Road <span class="del">existing</span> <span class="add">exiting the</span> s-curve; 4 new street lights.

</ul>

<span class="add">These are all light's we've agreed to with PSE&G.</span>

<p/>

In addition <span class="add">to that</span>, we are in discussions with PSE&G for

<ul>
  
<li> Installing 10 new lights on Bear Brook Road from Windsor Haven to Meadow Road, at intersections and the curve <span class="del">in the</span> <span class="add">on that</span> road.  <span class="add">There are no lights on that road at this time.</span>

</ul>

We continue to evaluate locations in town where upgrading or installing new <span class="del">street</span> lights is appropriate.  <span class="add">If you have suggestions, please pass it on.</span>

<p/>

Please be mindful <span class="add">that</span> it takes PSE&G approximately 4 to 6 months to install or upgrade lights after we give <span class="add">them</span> approval. So, it may be early fall before these projects are completed.

<p/>

Regarding flashing beacons at crosswalks -- these are far more expensive to install than street lights and the cost varies depending on the location <span class="del">and</span> <span class="add">based on what</span> available infrastructure <span class="add">is there</span>.  Every time <span class="add">we do</span> a road <span class="del">is redone</span>, we look for opportunities to make it more pedestrian and bicycle friendly <span class="del">including</span> <span class="add">which includes</span> whether a flashing beacon <span class="add">and sidewalks, and crosswalks</span> will be appropriate.

<p/>

This year we are evaluating crossing beacons at a number of locations:

<ul>
<li>We have already installed two on Bear Brook Road and one on Rabbit Hill Road <span class="add">near the Trolley Line Trail</span>.

<li>One is designed for Alexander Road at crosswalk to Nash Park and <span class="del">will be out to bid this</span> <span class="add">which should be installed by late</span> summer.

<li>One on Penn Lyle Road <span class="del">at the</span> <span class="add">and</span> Trolley Line crossing we are <span class="del">working with the contractor on pricing</span> <span class="add">discussing the pricing with the contractor.  And we hope that, too, will be installed by end of summer</span>.

<li>We are actively looking at three school <span class="del">crosswalks</span> <span class="add">crosswalk locations</span> on New Village Road <span class="del">at</span> <span class="add">near</span> Village School and Grover Middle school. <span class="add">And</span> also, at Penn Lyle and Canoe Brook near High School South.

</ul>


The <span class="del">location</span> <span class="add">locations</span> of these improvements is based on input from the Police and engineering.  Thank you to the Bicycle & Pedestrian Alliance, the Rabbit Hill <span class="add">Road</span> residents and other residents who have given input on crossing areas around town.

<p/>

Lastly there is always requests for <span class="add">more</span> sidewalks. It's a complicated issue because sometimes the residents who are responsible for maintaining the sidewalk after it's constructed are not <span class="add">as</span> enthusiastic about the project <span class="add">as other folks</span>. <span class="add">The Township does install the sidewalk, but once we install it, it's local resident's responsibility for snow cleaning and other maintenance of the sidewalk.</span>  As evidenced by the two phases of <span class="add">the</span> Cranbury Road sidewalks these projects take a long time. We are committed to extending the Cranbury Road sidewalk to connect <span class="del">it</span> to the Trolley line Trail near Rabbit Hill Road. <span class="del">The</span> <span class="add">This</span> budget <span class="add">that will be voted on tonight</span> allocates $50,000 to design <span class="del">the</span> <span class="add">that</span> extension. We hope to fund the construction cost of over $400,000 over the next two budgets.

<p/>

There is no argument that traffic has increased in town over the past 30 years since my family moved here. Residential developments both in West Windsor and surrounding towns contributed to this increase.  The state requires us to build new housing under the affordable housing legislation. As Mayor I am committed to doing whatever I can on both fronts to reduce development resulting in increased traffic and find solutions to the existing traffic problems. The fact is <span class="del">the</span> traffic in West Windsor will continue to increase due to developments approved by us and neighboring towns <span class="add">that are still under construction</span>.

<p/>

In order to reduce the burden, I am committed to reviving two <span class="del">bypasses</span> <span class="add">bypass</span> projects that have only been talked about <span class="del">for a number of years</span> <span class="add">since I moved to town</span> -- the Vaughn Drive Bypass and Penns Neck Bypass through SRI property.

<p/>

I am happy to report that <span class="add">the</span> first part of the Vaughn Drive Bypass, <span class="add">that is</span> connecting the new road "A" from Avalon development to the New Jersey Transit Train Station <span class="add">lot</span> is planned to be completed before this Fall. <span class="del">It</span> <span class="add">That</span> will provide an <span class="add">access</span> alternate path to residents of Avalon Development to get to Route 1 via Alexander Road. <span class="add">You'll have to go through the parking lot, but you can get there.</span>  We are in active discussions with the County to complete the remaining portion of the bypass to provide a proper connection to Alexander Road. I can't commit to <span class="del">a</span> <span class="add">the</span> timeframe <span class="add">because lot of other parties are involved</span>, but it has been my priority every year since I got elected Mayor.  <span class="add">And I am fairly confident that with the County Executive we will get it done.</span>

<p/>

Any development <span class="del">application</span> for SRI property <span class="add">that comes before me</span> <span class="del">will</span> require construction of <span class="del">the</span> Penns Neck Bypass connecting Washington Road through SRI property to Route 1 near Harrison Street. Since the <span class="add">proposed</span> road will be entirely through West Windsor we will not have to worry about objection from <span class="del">other</span> <span class="add">any of our neighboring</span> Townships.

<p/>

The good news is that <span class="del">once again</span> <span class="add">in spite of these spending increases</span> there is no tax increase in this budget - the municipal taxes are flat at 0.428 cents. Since I became Mayor in 2017 <span class="del">January</span> the total tax rate has increased from 0.418 in 2018 to 0.428 in 2024 <span class="del">for</span> an increase of 2.4% over a period of 7 years or approximately 1/3rd <span class="add">of a</span> percent <span class="del">(0.34%) annual increase in taxes</span> <span class="add">every year</span>. This while increasing our surplus from $1.5 million dollars when I got elected Mayor to $7.8 million dollars in the proposed budget an increase of over 420%.

<p/>

No wonder we continue to maintain our AAA rating making it less expensive to borrow for capital projects.

<p/>

The Township's excellent financial performance is a direct result of welcoming businesses to Town. When I became Mayor, I started TRC <span class="add">or</span> (Technical Review committee) to review applications before they <span class="del">came</span> <span class="add">come</span> to the Planning Board.  <span class="add">That has smoothed the process down and has moved applications much faster.</span>   We have attracted more businesses to Town. As a result, our total assessments increased by over $225 million over 7 years in spite of a temporary drop during Covid.

<p/>

From naysayers you <span class="add">will</span> constantly hear about warehouses, but the fact is although all our neighboring towns have built many warehouses, we don't have a single one in town <span class="add">yet</span>.  Instead, we have attracted many small businesses, just to name a few as examples <span class="add">and you will see Council members going for ribbon cutting all the time</span>:

<p/>

<ul>

<li>Kid Strong in <span class="del">Southfield Commons Shopping Center</span> <span class="add">McCaffrey's mall</span>

<li><span class="add">I can't pronounce it</span> Tous Les Jours, Mango Mango in <span class="del">Windsor Plaza</span> <span class="add">Woo Ri mart</span>

<li>Liberty Martial Art, Hutchinson Homes in Ellsworth Plaza

<li>Jersey Mike's Sub, <span class="del">Smile Flossophy,</span> along 571

<li>Rumble Boxing in <span class="del">Windsor Green</span> <span class="add">Whole Foods Market mall</span>

<li>More Than Q, The Container Store, Starbucks in <span class="del">the Square at West Windsor</span> <span class="add">Trader Joe's mall</span>.

<li>Oceans Job Lot, Floor & decor, Bluestone Lane Cafe, just salad, Goldfish Swim School, Burn Boot Camp, Planet Fitness, Pasar Malam, Playa bowls, in Nassau Park Pavilion

</ul>


<span class="add">And I have probably not named many more that have come to town.</span>

<p/>

Many new <span class="del">small</span> businesses will be part of what will <span class="del">be</span> <span class="add">become</span> the bustling, walkable downtown area on Princeton Hightstown Road that many have asked for over the years. We have been working closely with Mercer County on redoing that section of <span class="del">Route</span> 571 <span class="add">between Cranbury Road and Clarksville Road</span> to improve bicycle, pedestrian and road safety with sidewalks and safer crossings. <span class="add">Again,</span> I am optimistic that with the new county executive the project will move <span class="del">quicker</span> <span class="add">much faster than it has moved during the last six years</span>.

<p/>

I am happy to report that the retail environment in West Windsor is healthy. <span class="del">I</span> <span class="add">I'll</span> encourage all residents to support these great businesses and all others in town.

<p/>

This brings me to unfortunate wasteful spending that we must include in the budget.  Last year we spent $125,000 out of budgeted $275,000 defending a baseless lawsuit against approval of the Bridgepoint 8 warehouse complex on Quakerbridge Road <span class="add">which is</span> at the edge of <span class="add">our</span> town. The courts ruled in our favor on every count of the lawsuit in an unambiguous fashion. Sadly, the plaintiffs who are West Windsor residents and taxpayers chose to appeal which has forced us to budget another $254,000 this year to defend <span class="del">the</span> <span class="add">that</span> lawsuit.  <span class="add">That's like pulling four or five crossing beacons.</span>

<p/>

With the approval of new affordable housing legislation and potential of the site to house over 3000 apartments I had hoped the plaintiffs would see the light but sadly we are forced to spend taxpayers' money in an unproductive fashion.

<p/>

This brings me to the topic of affordable housing, a state mandate I have spent considerable time making sure does not adversely affect West Windsor. The legislature came up with a new law and process for each Township to fulfill <span class="del">their</span> <span class="add">our</span> affordable housing obligation. The new process has never been used so it's <span class="del">anyone's</span> <span class="add">anybody's</span> guess how well it will work. However, West Windsor always has <span class="del">the</span> bull's <span class="del">eye</span> <span class="add">eyes</span> on our back because every builder wants to build in <span class="del">town</span> <span class="add">West Windsor.  It's easy to sell the houses and make profit</span>. I want to make sure we do everything possible to prepare ourselves for the next round.

<p/>

<span class="add">Under the new legislation passed </span> The Township is required to file various reports with <span class="add">the DCA</span> the Department of Community Affairs between June and September. By October 20th of this year the <span class="del">Department of Community Affairs</span> <span class="add">DCA</span> will publish their non- binding obligation of each town. <span class="add">So they will essentially tell us how many units we are responsible for.  And again, our ratio in our town is 25%, so if they say you need one unit, then we need to build three regular price units for every one affordable unit.  So we end up building four times as many units as they tell our obligation is.</span>  By January 31st of next year West Windsor Council is either required to adopt a binding resolution either accepting the number assigned by the <span class="del">Department of Community Affairs</span> <span class="add">DCA</span> or a number based on <span class="del">its</span> <span class="add">our</span> own determination of our fourth-round obligation. A lengthy process will follow that resolution and <span class="del">the</span> potential of landing in court is significant.  <span class="add">Just as a reference,</span> During the last round West Windsor spent <span class="del">about</span> <span class="add">over</span> $500,000 coming <span class="del">up</span> with a settlement with <span class="add">the</span> Fair Share Housing center. I hope given how proactive West Windsor is, we will not have to spend unproductive money on lawsuits to come up with our fourth-round obligation.

<p/>

I want to assure residents that we have already started work to protect our interests.  When <span class="del">Department of Community Affairs</span> <span class="add">DCA</span> determines our obligation by October 20th, <span class="del">2024</span> we will be prepared with the homework. I will keep <span class="add">all</span> residents updated as the process moves along.

<p/>

Since I <span class="del">was</span> <span class="add">became</span> elected Mayor, every year a group of volunteers have hosted the Mayor's Ball. It's not an official Township function but run by a group of volunteers. They raise funds for a non-profit organization and <span class="add">have</span> so far, <span class="del">have</span> raised funds for both Volunteer Fire Departments, Police Department, the Historical Society and <span class="del">the</span> Arts Council.  <span class="add">And we sadly lost two years during COVID.</span>  This year's recipient is Attitude in Reverse <span class="add">or</span> "AIR". AIR is a great <span class="add">local</span> organization that does work in breaking down stigma associated with mental illness. The founders Trish and Kurt Baker, local residents <span class="add">have</span> channeled their personal pain into helping others. <span class="add">And I've been fortunate to know them all these years.</span>  The Mayor's ball committee will hold various events around town throughout the year. The first event of the year is Dive into Summer at West Windsor Waterworks, on June 21st. Please support this worthy cause in whatever form you can.

<p/>

As the Mayor I may be the face of the Township, but the Town is run by various Township boards and committees appointed by the Mayor and Township Council. Many volunteers continue to serve for a number of years <span class="add">without any compensation</span> <span class="del">on our</span> <span class="add">Some of the committees and boards are:</span>  Agricultural Advisory & Affordable Housing Committee, Human Relations Council, Environmental <span class="del">Commission, Board of</span> Recreation and Shade Tree Commission, Planning and Zoning Boards.

<p/>

We are also blessed with <span class="add">some</span> other volunteer organizations not related to Township government such as <span class="add">the</span> two Volunteer Fire Departments, FOWWOS <span class="add">or Friends Of West Windsor Open Space</span>, WWBPA <span class="add">West Windsor Bicycle and Pedestrian Alliance</span>, Farmers' Market and <span class="del">the</span> Parking Authority. They all make West Windsor a great place to live.  <span class="add">You will find many of those volunteers in the audience today so please thank them.</span>

<p/>

Please thank these volunteers for their selfless service to the Township.

<p/>

Before I close, I would like to acknowledge one special individual for whom this is her last State of the Township Address as an employee. Gay Huber our Township Clerk is going to retire in a few months after <span class="del">over</span> 35 years of service to the Township in various capacities.  She is a lifelong West Windsor resident having <span class="del">been</span> born and brought up in West Windsor <span class="add">graduating from "the" High School, as she would say</span>.  If any of you want to complain about all the taxes you have paid over the years, she has <span class="add">beat</span> you <span class="del">beat</span> by a mile <span class="del">so don't complain</span>. Apart from being a Township employee, she and her family <span class="del">volunteer</span> <span class="add">have volunteered</span> for the Fire Department and Historical Society among other volunteer activities. Although technically <span class="del">the</span> Township Clerk works for the Township Council and <span class="del">thus the</span> <span class="add">that mean's she's my</span> opposition, I am thankful for <span class="add">all</span> the support she has given me since I got elected Mayor.

<p/>

Gay thanks <span class="del">to</span> you and your family for your service to West Windsor <span class="del">in every capacity</span>.  You will be missed.  <span class="add">Thank you.</span>

<p/>

As I meet <span class="del">many</span> people around town, I am honored and humbled by your kind words and support. Thanks for the opportunity you have given me since 2001 to serve in various capacities as School Board Member, <span class="add">School Board</span> President, Council Member and <span class="add">currently</span> as your Mayor.

<p/>

Given the craziness going on in partisan politics today, I am glad West Windsor has a non-partisan form of government. It's a privilege being the Mayor of one of the best towns in the country. God bless West Windsor; God bless the State of New Jersey and God bless America.  <span class="add">Thank you.</span>
