Good Afternoon,

I would like to set up our next opportunity to discuss the implementation a=
nd process for proceeding with Class III Police Officers.  In speaking with=
 Chief Garofalo and Chief Armour we have tentatively held Tuesday, June 5th=
 from 10:30 - 12:30 for our next discussion.

Further, I believe we would be best suited to have both the township attorn=
ey (which I believe is the same firm) and the district attorney (Comegno La=
w Group) attend to review the contract and discuss the logistics of the nex=
t steps.  Rob, Guy, and I have shared draft contracts to assist in our disc=
ussion with the larger group.

I have reserved C110/C111 at the Board of Education Offices for the meeting=
.

It is probably also a good idea to have Greg and Joanne join us.  I didn't =
have their email addresses readily available.

Please let me know if you are able to join us.

Sincerely,

Dave
