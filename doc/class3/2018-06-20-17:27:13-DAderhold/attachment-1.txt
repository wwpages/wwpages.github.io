I can prepare a list of responses to Linda and the council to address some issues apart from council presentation to try to separate some of her topics

Virginia is okay with the program.  The only question Alison had was about training and Ayesha asked the same question.

Once Mark describes what training our police department does, I want to answer the question about “bias” etc. I don’t want this to be a forum to bash police officers.

I will request you to describe how the police will be used by school district and why you feel need for them. Let Mark describe what type of training we offer the police officers and let me handle all other policy questions.

If you feel the need we can meet on Monday at 3:30 p.m. to go over the questions. I have a department head meeting starting at 2:30 which Mark will attend since the Chief is out. You can come over at 3:30 and we can finalize who answers which questions.

Thanks

The other two are not submitting questions as per Gay.

David,

I am going to pull in questions from all three ladies so far and sort them as to which I want you to answer and which I want Mark to answer and which questions I will handle.  Enjoy graduation and we will talk tomorrow.

Sorry-hit send too soon.

1.  What specifically will the police officers be doing in the schools.  The video from the SB presentation talks about fulfilling a counsellor function-what training have these officers received for that role?

2.  Detailed description of the type of training that the WWPD and/or school district will be providing to Class III officers to address issues of unconscious bias.  Will any kind of training be provided to address these issues and what will the scope of that training be?

I preface these questions with the following statement:

I am extremely supportive of our police department and am not opposed to having armed police officers in the schools.  My concern stems from two areas-what will these officers be asked to do in the schools and how will these officers be trained for their new role of interacting with children on a daily basis.

1.

2.Please provide me with a detailed description of the type of training that the WWPD and/or the school district will be providing to any Class III officer or employee hired by the WWPD.
