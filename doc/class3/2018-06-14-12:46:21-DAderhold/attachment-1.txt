Hemant,

Thanks.

To answer your question, the police will have no disciplinary powers in school.  That is the responsibility of the administration.  

I will be more than ready.  I would suggest that Linda be met with in advance with either Garf/Mark/you/me.  

If the questions she asks at the planning board are any indication we are in for a long night.  I cannot believe I had to listed to DNA testing of dog excrement at the last meeting.

David,

I had a long conversation with Mark Lee following last board meeting. We were in the parking lot till past 9 p.m. I feel we made even Veronica feel little better about the program. 

As I mentioned to you if anyone asks you any questions regarding the police, i.e. hiring, training, discipline etc you simply turn to them and say it's the Mayor's call and let me handle it.

You should respond to what the officers are allowed to participate in during school. Main questions you can expect is what disciplinary powers the police will have in school. That is going to be your call.  

As I refer questions about "whether to have officer in school" to you, you should refer all questions regarding police to me as ultimately it's my decision along with the Chief. 

The video of our last meeting is online. Please watch the discussion that starts around 1:56:45 mark in the video to get an idea regarding what to expect.

Regarding Alison, the process has now started and let it play out to it's natural conclusion. In my 9 years as school board President and 6 months as mayor I have yet not lost a vote and I am not about to start now. I have your back. Please don't get worked up and let me handle it :)

Thanks

Hemant

FYI

Hemant,

If the council thinks I am going to allow them to disparage the police of either community or the school district they are mistaken.

I trust you will keep this professional.

I will not play their politics and I will say what needs to be said very publically if the council steps out of line.

Further, I strongly recommend that Alice recuses herself from questions.

Gay,

Good Afternoon.  I will be present on June 25th for a discussion on Class III Officers as the Board of Education will be formally voting on the Shared Service Agreement on June 26th.  Mark Lee and Tony Fleres will be with me.

In order to prepare for the presentation I would ask that I receive questions no later than Wednesday, June 20th.  With multiple graduations next week I will need time to prepare.

Sincerely,

Dave
