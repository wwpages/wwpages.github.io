Subject: RE: Tuesday, June 5th

Good Morning,

Sorry I didn't respond again last night...celebrating my 4 year olds birthd=
ay (youngest of five)

I have attached a few documents for your review.

The first is a document from Howell.  This was received after the draft agr=
eement was put together an may offer additional language for consideration.

Then there is a draft agreement for WW and Plainsboro.  Identical except fo=
r names.

The fourth document is a budget document for district projected expenses.  =
There are two tabs on the bottom so the sub total must combine the two tabs=
 (over 800K).  I have built in a lump sum for overtime (originally we discu=
ssed 13 officers...due to jurisdiction concerns I eliminated one officer go=
ing to 6 each with overtime rates in case of coverage needs).  Also, I buil=
t in a Sgt. Rate of 10K for oversight.  I know both forces have different c=
ommand structures but I wanted to budget in some money to offset any manage=
ment increase.

Lastly, I have included a draft resolution for WW and Plainsboro Townships =
modeled after the North Brunswick Township Resolution.

I have confirmed with Mark Toscano from Comegno that he is planning on atte=
nding.  Due to the amount of work needed to make this happen I believe we n=
eed to involve our attorneys right away to guide us through this process.

Sincerely,

Dave

Dave - that time and date works for me.   Can you please send Marlena and I=
 the draft contracts to review prior to the mtg so we have the ability to c=
onverse at the 6/5 mtg.

I would prefer we make our way through the policy and financial matters fir=
st, then have the district attorney discuss the key legal issues at the mtg=
, and let Marlena and I work it through our attorney after this mtg.  This =
is my opinion, if Marlena feels differently, she can say so.

Thanks, look forward to the mtg.

Anthony

Good Afternoon,

I would like to set up our next opportunity to discuss the implementation a=
nd process for proceeding with Class III Police Officers.  In speaking with=
 Chief Garofalo and Chief Armour we have tentatively held Tuesday, June 5th=
 from 10:30 - 12:30 for our next discussion.

Further, I believe we would be best suited to have both the township attorn=
ey (which I believe is the same firm) and the district attorney (Comegno La=
w Group) attend to review the contract and discuss the logistics of the nex=
t steps.  Rob, Guy, and I have shared draft contracts to assist in our disc=
ussion with the larger group.

I have reserved C110/C111 at the Board of Education Offices for the meeting=
.

It is probably also a good idea to have Greg and Joanne join us.  I didn't =
have their email addresses readily available.

Please let me know if you are able to join us.

Sincerely,

Dave
