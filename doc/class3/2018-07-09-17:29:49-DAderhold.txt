Subject: some policy questions
Dear Mr. Fleres,

How are you? I hope all is well with you and your family.

I am still confused as to why it is necessary to change the current system =
of the police officers being stationed outside the schools in their cars? W=
hy is it necessary for the officers to be inside the schools given the lega=
l and financial risks of them interacting with and transporting students? T=
he liability to our township is too great a risk, given that we can still p=
rotect the kids with the officers stationed outside of the school.

As a child psychiatrist, I am very concerned about the psychological impact=
 of our kids being exposed to a gun on daily basis. Our kids are growing up=
 in a different time and seeing reports of brutality and bias in the news e=
veryday. Some kids may feel frightened by the presence of an armed police o=
fficer in the school. Especially when the news has a multiplicity of report=
s like this:
https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/01/25/black-students-more-likely-to=
-be-arrested.html https://mic.com/articles/188694/school-resource-officers-=
have-abused-black-kids-for-years-some-parkland-teens-want-more-of-them#.vOo=
OFw2t5 https://mic.com/articles/188135/parkland-school-safety-and-the-devas=
tating-effects-law-enforcement-can-have-on-black-and-brown-kids#.vOoOFw2t5 =
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school-to-prison-pipeline_us_5a8ee0afe=
4b077f5bfec2cf3 I am worried about how this fear may negatively impact thei=
r performance, their mental wellbeing and mental health. It is an unfortuna=
te fact that students are exposed to the news coverage above, even though t=
he vast majority of officers, particularly in our town, are well-trained an=
d protect their communities and show respect to all people, regardless of r=
ace, sex, and gender.
The psychological health and wellbeing of our kids is as important as their=
 physical health. We are capable of protecting them with officers stationed=
 outside of the school. Why expose them to unnecessary stress if we can pre=
vent doing so?


Thank you for your care and concern for our community.
Take care, Kani


p.s.
Please read West Windsor Councilwoman Ayesha Hamilton's perspective on the =
contract allowing armed police in WW-P schools. Ayesha is an experienced la=
wyer and has some great insights to share.<https://nextdoor.com/news_feed/?=
post=3D86490436>

<https://nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=3D86490436>

Is this Shared Services Contract for SROs in the WW-P schools a good and re=
asonable expenditure for West Windsor and Plainsboro? What is the scope of =
our actual liability? Do the contract provisions themselves actually protec=
t the town from liability? What happens if a police officer does something =
improper at the schools or is even just accused of doing something improper=
 at the schools? The parent sues the schools and the Township because he is=
 our employee. The schools pay the parents. The Township pays the parents. =
Then the Township pays the schools for their defense and anything they paid=
 the parent. It is also possible and quite likely that the Joint Insurance =
Fund will disclaim coverage and that the taxpayers will pay. Negligent acts=
 will be covered by insurance. It is the acts outside the scope of the offi=
cer's official duties that will not be covered and which are more likely to=
 be the actions for which a parent will sue the school and the township. Yo=
u, as the tax payer, will have paid twice if a liability claim is raised, o=
nce through the schools and once through the township indemnification claus=
e. While they are two entities, the pocket is the same- yours. A portion of=
 this may be covered by the Joint Insurance Fund but it is also likely that=
 JIF could disclaim coverage because of what the officer did, i.e. if he as=
saults (or is claimed to have assaulted) a child it would be considered an =
intentional act and therefore, outside the scope of the Insurance coverage.=
 Most insurance policies have exclusions for certain actions, usually discl=
aiming coverage for intentional acts. Why should the West Windsor and Plain=
sboro townships indemnify the actions of the officer? We, as a Township, di=
d not ask for these additional officers in the schools, so why should we be=
 asked to indemnify their actions? This liability should lie squarely with =
the School District since it is their plan initiated and designed by them. =
Take a closer look at the contract and see the clauses permitting these off=
icers to transport our children because they will not be using police cars =
and will be driving private vehicle. Their vehicles will not be covered by =
the Joint Insurance Fund and we may not know what the coverage limits are s=
ince they will be privately insured. Further, if the SLEO III's job is to r=
emain at the schools, why does the shared services agreement allow them to =
transport children? This contract does not protect the interests of our tow=
nship and could potentially be the source of highly expensive lawsuits that=
 are not covered by insurance. Does this make sense? What is wrong with the=
 current system of the police officers being stationed outside the schools =
in their cars? Why is it necessary for them to be inside the schools given =
the legal and financial risks of them interacting with and transporting stu=
dents?


Please be advised that the Township of West Windsor is subject to the New J=
ersey Open Public Records Act. As such, any email sent or received by the T=
ownship may be subject to a records request.

 child it would be considered an
 intentional act and therefore, outside the scope of the Insurance coverage=
. Most insurance policies have exclusions for certain actions, usually disc=
laiming coverage for intentional acts. Why should the West Windsor and Plai=
nsboro townships indemnify the actions
 of the officer? We, as a Township, did not ask for these additional office=
rs in the schools, so why should we be asked to indemnify their actions? Th=
is liability should lie squarely with the School District since it is their=
 plan initiated and designed by
 them. Take a closer look at the contract and see the clauses permitting th=
ese officers to transport our children because they will not be using polic=
e cars and will be driving private vehicle. Their vehicles will not be cove=
red by the Joint Insurance Fund
 and we may not know what the coverage limits are since they will be privat=
ely insured. Further, if the SLEO III's job is to remain at the schools, wh=
y does the shared services agreement allow them to transport children? This=
 contract does not protect the interests
 of our township and could potentially be the source of highly expensive la=
wsuits that are not covered by insurance. Does this make sense? What is wro=
ng with the current system of the police officers being stationed outside t=
he schools in their cars? Why is
 it necessary for them to be inside the schools given the legal and financi=
al risks of them interacting with and transporting students?
