<div><br>
</div>
<div>I am extremely supportive of our police department and am not opposed to having armed police officers in the schools.&nbsp; My concern stems from two areas-what will these officers be asked to do in the schools and how will these officers be trained for their
 new role of interacting with children on a daily basis.</div>
