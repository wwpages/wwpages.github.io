I preface these questions with the following statement:

I am extremely supportive of our police department and am not opposed to having armed police officers in the schools.  My concern stems from two areas-what will these officers be asked to do in the schools and how will these officers be trained for their new role of interacting with children on a daily basis.

2.Please provide me with a detailed description of the type of training that the WWPD and/or the school district will be providing to any Class III officer or employee hired by the WWPD.
