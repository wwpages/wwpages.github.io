An unarmed officer makes no sense

There is no validity to that

It doesn=92t make common sense

> Hello,

> I am a resident of West Windsor and recently heard of the resolution to p=
lace armed "Resource Officers" in our schools, including our elementary sch=
ools. While I understand the fear of a mass shooting, I don't think that th=
e solution is for an officer to carry a weapon around our schools. Looking =
at the states where shootings have occurred, they've occurred in states wit=
h lax gun laws (not a descriptor for NJ, to say the least). Therefore, I do=
n't think that the solution in NJ, especially in this town, is to introduce=
 guns into the schools, making an object that was once largely inaccessible=
 now available, walking down the halls with its owner every day. If we had =
biometric triggers, that'd be one thing, but we don't yet.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> For safety, I would much prefer that guns be kept in a gun safe(s) where =
only the officer knows the codes/has access to the safe, or the officer sta=
ys in the front office and have the unarmed security officers who are alrea=
dy in the schools do the patrolling. The last thing we need is a tussle bet=
ween student and officer and the student gets the gun or the officer fears =
for his life and now we have a dead kid, kids, or dead officer. My husband =
and I both graduated WWPHS South in the mid-2000s - we had security officer=
s at that time who patrolled and that system was working just fine. The sit=
uations the officer is most likely to encounter day to day won't require a =
gun to solve, so why have the gun transported at all times throughout the s=
chool?
>=20
>=20
>=20
> Finally, if you're going through with this, I suggest limiting employment=
 to State Police only. They have much more extensive training than local co=
ps and will be less biased than a cop who's lived here a long time and know=
s all the families.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> All in all, I am against this plan for many, many reasons beyond the gun =
issue and honestly this is something that will make me reconsider staying i=
n this town and sending my kids through this system.
