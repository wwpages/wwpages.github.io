Good Afternoon,

I would like to set up our next opportunity to discuss the implementation and process for proceeding with Class III Police Officers.  In speaking with Chief Garofalo and Chief Armour we have tentatively held Tuesday, June 5th from 10:30 - 12:30 for our next discussion.

Further, I believe we would be best suited to have both the township attorney (which I believe is the same firm) and the district attorney (Comegno Law Group) attend to review the contract and discuss the logistics of the next steps.  Rob, Guy, and I have shared draft contracts to assist in our discussion with the larger group.

I have reserved C110/C111 at the Board of Education Offices for the meeting.

It is probably also a good idea to have Greg and Joanne join us.  I didn't have their email addresses readily available.

Please let me know if you are able to join us.

Sincerely,

Dave
