An unarmed officer makes no sense

There is no validity to that

It doesn’t make common sense

> I am a resident of West Windsor and recently heard of the resolution to place armed "Resource Officers" in our schools, including our elementary schools. While I understand the fear of a mass shooting, I don't think that the solution is for an officer to carry a weapon around our schools. Looking at the states where shootings have occurred, they've occurred in states with lax gun laws (not a descriptor for NJ, to say the least). Therefore, I don't think that the solution in NJ, especially in this town, is to introduce guns into the schools, making an object that was once largely inaccessible now available, walking down the halls with its owner every day. If we had biometric triggers, that'd be one thing, but we don't yet.

The last thing we need is a tussle between student and officer and the student gets the gun or the officer fears for his life and now we have a dead kid, kids, or dead officer. My husband and I both graduated WWPHS South in the mid-2000s - we had security officers at that time who patrolled and that system was working just fine. The situations the officer is most likely to encounter day to day won't require a gun to solve, so why have the gun transported at all times throughout the school?
