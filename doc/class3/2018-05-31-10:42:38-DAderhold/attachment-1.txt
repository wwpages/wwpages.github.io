My opinion is it will be advantageous to have legal reps present on both side to assist in facilitating this process

Time is of the essence and we need to move this forward.

I will send the draft later when I get to my computer

Dave – that time and date works for me.   Can you please send Marlena and I the draft contracts to review prior to the mtg so we have the ability to converse at the 6/5 mtg.

I would prefer we make our way through the policy and financial matters first, then have the district attorney discuss the key legal issues at the mtg, and let Marlena and I work it through our attorney after this mtg.  This is my opinion, if Marlena feels differently, she can say so.

Thanks, look forward to the mtg.

Good Afternoon,

I would like to set up our next opportunity to discuss the implementation and process for proceeding with Class III Police Officers.  In speaking with Chief Garofalo and Chief Armour we have tentatively held Tuesday, June 5th from 10:30 – 12:30 for our next discussion.

Further, I believe we would be best suited to have both the township attorney (which I believe is the same firm) and the district attorney (Comegno Law Group) attend to review the contract and discuss the logistics of the next steps.  Rob, Guy, and I have shared draft contracts to assist in our discussion with the larger group.

I have reserved C110/C111 at the Board of Education Offices for the meeting.

It is probably also a good idea to have Greg and Joanne join us.  I didn’t have their email addresses readily available.

Please let me know if you are able to join us.

Sincerely,

Dave
