Hello,



I am a resident of West Windsor and recently heard of the resolution to pla=
ce armed "Resource Officers" in our schools, including our elementary schoo=
ls. While I understand the fear of a mass shooting, I don't think that the =
solution is for an officer to carry a weapon around our schools. Looking at=
 the states where shootings have occurred, they've occurred in states with =
lax gun laws (not a descriptor for NJ, to say the least). Therefore, I don'=
t think that the solution in NJ, especially in this town, is to introduce g=
uns into the schools, making an object that was once largely inaccessible n=
ow available, walking down the halls with its owner every day. If we had bi=
ometric triggers, that'd be one thing, but we don't yet.



For safety, I would much prefer that guns be kept in a gun safe(s) where on=
ly the officer knows the codes/has access to the safe, or the officer stays=
 in the front office and have the unarmed security officers who are already=
 in the schools do the patrolling. The last thing we need is a tussle betwe=
en student and officer and the student gets the gun or the officer fears fo=
r his life and now we have a dead kid, kids, or dead officer. My husband an=
d I both graduated WWPHS South in the mid-2000s - we had security officers =
at that time who patrolled and that system was working just fine. The situa=
tions the officer is most likely to encounter day to day won't require a gu=
n to solve, so why have the gun transported at all times throughout the sch=
ool?



Finally, if you're going through with this, I suggest limiting employment t=
o State Police only. They have much more extensive training than local cops=
 and will be less biased than a cop who's lived here a long time and knows =
all the families.



All in all, I am against this plan for many, many reasons beyond the gun is=
sue and honestly this is something that will make me reconsider staying in =
this town and sending my kids through this system.
