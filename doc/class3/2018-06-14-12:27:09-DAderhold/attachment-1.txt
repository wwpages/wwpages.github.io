FYI

Hemant,

If the council thinks I am going to allow them to disparage the police of either community or the school district they are mistaken.

I trust you will keep this professional.

I will not play their politics and I will say what needs to be said very publically if the council steps out of line.

Further, I strongly recommend that Alice recuses herself from questions.

Gay,

Good Afternoon.  I will be present on June 25th for a discussion on Class III Officers as the Board of Education will be formally voting on the Shared Service Agreement on June 26th.  Mark Lee and Tony Fleres will be with me.

In order to prepare for the presentation I would ask that I receive questions no later than Wednesday, June 20th.  With multiple graduations next week I will need time to prepare.

Sincerely,

Dave
