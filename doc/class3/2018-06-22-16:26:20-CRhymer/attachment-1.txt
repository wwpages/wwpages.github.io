Hi Dr. Aderhold,

Marlena has reviewed the attached Share Services Agreement with the following changes:

Pages 3-4

Section IV(G)(b).  Duties of SLEO III - can, may - which word should be used "can" or "may"?  Please advise

Page 4

Section IV(K) - reads: "...may attend periodic briefings and meetings...All efforts will be made to coordinate this training" - should this sentence refer to "attending briefings and meetings or activities" instead of "coordinate this training"?  In IV(J) "complete all training" is already mentioned.  Please advise.

Page 4

Section IV(N) - reads:  "...in accordance with the Uniform Memorandum of Agreement."  Is this the same document as referenced in Section V(K) Page 5 - "...Uniform State Memorandum of Agreement between Education and Law Enforcement Officials, Departmental Standard Operating Procedures and General Orders"?  Please advise.

Page 6

Sections VIII(F) & (G) -  fix left margin alignment.

Page 7-8

Section VIII(I) - is blank.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

Thanks.
