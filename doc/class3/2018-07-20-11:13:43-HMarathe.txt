Linda,

Lot of these questions have already been answered in different forums, e.g.=
 Will SRO have power to arrest police officers and=20
then there are questions we are not going to answer, i.e. where are the pol=
ice officers going to be stationed. We don't want to advertise our=20
procedures.

We will collect all questions and answer them on July 30th. I will again re=
iterate that we are not debating whether to have police in school and how t=
he school uses them. That
is their decision. The council's decision is whether they want to have a jo=
int shared service agreement with the school district.=20

Thanks

Hemant

I expect to keep receiving all sort of emails with comments and very specif=
ic questions. How all this is handled is very important so that misinformat=
ion is not given out. Answers need to be centralized so that residents aren=
=92t getting five different answers from five council members. You and Lt. =
Lee have been doing so at meetings, but now the emails are becoming more nu=
merous.

I=92m copying the mayor, council president and various administrators on th=
is email so that we can consider having one or two professionals answering =
these questions directly back to the residents with elected officials copie=
d. In my opinion, we need to figure out something now.

Dear West Windsor Town Council,

My name is Ane Rudorfer, and I am a resident of West Windsor and a 2015 gra=
duate of WW-P South. It has recently come to my attention that the WW-P sch=
ool board has approved a plan to put in place armed officers in schools. I =
am writing this letter in order to request that the town council halt the p=
lan to have armed police in schools.

I understand that the impetus for the creation of this policy is a response=
 to the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Florida this past February. Whi=
le the reason for installing armed police officers in school is to guarante=
e student safety in case of a violent response, there is no specific eviden=
ce that it will do so. A 2013 study by the Congressional Research Service f=
ound no evidence that schools with SROs had fewer shootings than those with=
out them. In fact, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had an SRO statione=
d outside of the school, which did nothing to prevent a shooting. In additi=
on to not fulfilling the purpose of making schools safer, placing SROs in s=
chools can have unintended consequences. Schools with SROs arrest twice as =
many students as those without SROs. Often students are arrested for trivia=
l infractions such as throwing paper airplanes and wearing sagging pants.

I also have several concerns about the proposed policy that I have addresse=
d. They are the following:

1.     Will SROs receive special training on how to interact with students =
in a way that considers their age (e.g. differentiation in policing strateg=
ies between elementary, middle, and high school)?

2.     In what parts of schools will police officers be stationed?

3.     Will SROs have the power to arrest students on school property, or w=
ill students who commit behavioral infractions be referred to the school ad=
ministration? If so, for what particular infractions?

4.     If SROs are not able to arrest students on school property, will the=
y be able to refer students for arrest. If so, for what infractions?

5.     Will SROs be required to carry guns with Smartgun technology (e.g. g=
uns that automatically lock and cannot be unlocked without the owner=92s fi=
ngerprint scan)?

6.     In what cases will SROs be allowed to fire their weapons?

7.     Where will SROs be required to store their guns?

8.     What steps will the town council and the school board take to ensure=
 that weapons do not fall into the wrong hands?


Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I hope to hear back=
 from you soon.
Sincerely, Ane
