Hemant,

Thanks.

To answer your question, the police will have no disciplinary powers in sch=
ool.  That is the responsibility of the administration. =20

I will be more than ready.  I would suggest that Linda be met with in advan=
ce with either Garf/Mark/you/me. =20

If the questions she asks at the planning board are any indication we are i=
n for a long night.  I cannot believe I had to listed to DNA testing of dog=
 excrement at the last meeting. =20

David,

I had a long conversation with Mark Lee following last board meeting. We we=
re in the parking lot till past 9 p.m. I feel we made even Veronica feel li=
ttle better about the program.=20

As I mentioned to you if anyone asks you any questions regarding the police=
, i.e. hiring, training, discipline etc you simply turn to them and say it'=
s the Mayor's call and let me handle it.

You should respond to what the officers are allowed to participate in durin=
g school. Main questions you can expect is what disciplinary powers the pol=
ice will have in school. That is going to be your call. =20

As I refer questions about "whether to have officer in school" to you, you =
should refer all questions regarding police to me as ultimately it's my dec=
ision along with the Chief.=20

The video of our last meeting is online. Please watch the discussion that s=
tarts around 1:56:45 mark in the video to get an idea regarding what to exp=
ect.=20

http://westwindsornj.org/TC-documents/2018/tc-video-061118.html


Regarding Alison, the process has now started and let it play out to it's n=
atural conclusion. In my 9 years as school board President and 6 months as =
mayor I have yet not lost a vote and I am not about to start now. I have yo=
ur back. Please don't get worked up and let me handle it :)

Thanks

Hemant

FYI

Hemant,

If the council thinks I am going to allow them to disparage the police of e=
ither community or the school district they are mistaken.

I trust you will keep this professional.

I will not play their politics and I will say what needs to be said very pu=
blically if the council steps out of line.

Further, I strongly recommend that Alice recuses herself from questions.

Gay,

Good Afternoon.  I will be present on June 25th for a discussion on Class I=
II Officers as the Board of Education will be formally voting on the Shared=
 Service Agreement on June 26th.  Mark Lee and Tony Fleres will be with me.

In order to prepare for the presentation I would ask that I receive questio=
ns no later than Wednesday, June 20th.  With multiple graduations next week=
 I will need time to prepare.

Sincerely,

Dave
