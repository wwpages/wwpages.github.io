Thank you.  What are the limitations and exclusions referenced in Barbara's=
 email?  Can you modify the indemnification language to reflect exclusions =
for anything not covered by the JIF policy. That way the tax payers are not=
 being hit for the same bill twice, once when the School Board pays the cla=
im and another time when we indemnify the SB for the acts of our employee t=
hat are outside the coverage limits.

Marlena,

With respects to the insurance and indemnification language contained in th=
is agreement, the Fund's coverage documents would provide for indemnificati=
on of liability assumed via a mutual aid agreement (including indemnificati=
on for defense costs). This coverage is pursuant to the terms, conditions, =
limitations, and exclusions of the JIF Casualty Insurance Policy. Costs out=
side of the coverage documents would not be provided through the Fund.  The=
 Title 59 (Tort Claims Act) protections and limitations would be afforded i=
n the same manner regardless of the liability assumed in any agreement.

The intention of the cross-indemnification language in the agreement is to =
have each party obligate itself to compensate the other party for harm or l=
oss to avoid having both parties paying the same claim twice.

Regards,

Barbara

All:

I would like written confirmation from the Mayor and/or Marlena that the JI=
F is comfortable with the indemnity language contained in the Shared Servic=
es Agreement and that they will not disclaim coverage if indemnity is sough=
t.  If indemnification is outside the coverage limits, please confirm for m=
e what source will be used to cover the indemnification.

The reason this is a concern is because there may be protections and limita=
tions to suit provided by the NJ Tort Claims Act which may be affected by y=
our indemnification language.

Further, since we are thinking of this all as "one pocket", my concern is t=
hat our tax payers are paying the claim sought for indemnification through =
the school taxes and then again through the township taxes when the Town in=
demnifies the school.  When we are looking at the "same pocket" of funds, i=
.e. the tax payer, then the indemnification clause means that they are esse=
ntially paying on the same claim twice.

Thank you.  I look forward to your prompt response.

Very truly yours,
