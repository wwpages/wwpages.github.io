Good Morning,

I am writing to confirm tomorrow's meeting to review the resolution and agr=
eement to implement Class III Police Officers in WWP schools for Fall 2018.=
  The goal of the meeting is to solidify the timeline, language of the agre=
ement and cost parameters.  (Clearly this will need to be reviewed by all m=
embers of council, mayors and the Board of Education).

I ask that everyone come forward tomorrow with solutions to make this happe=
n.

A majority of the Board of Education is supportive with the implementation.=
  As such I am authorized to solidify the process.  I ask that everyone com=
e ready to work to a solution for implementation of Class III Police Office=
rs in our schools.

As such, WWP will be bringing out Board Attorney to the meeting to assist i=
n facilitating.  I ask the townships to reconsider and bring representation=
 to assist in this process.

I am out today (chaperoning my Kindergartner's field trip).  I look forward=
 to our 10:30 meeting tomorrow at the Board of Education Office.

Sincerely,

Dave

My opinion is it will be advantageous to have legal reps present on both si=
de to assist in facilitating this process

Time is of the essence and we need to move this forward.

I will send the draft later when I get to my computer

Dave - that time and date works for me.   Can you please send Marlena and I=
 the draft contracts to review prior to the mtg so we have the ability to c=
onverse at the 6/5 mtg.

I would prefer we make our way through the policy and financial matters fir=
st, then have the district attorney discuss the key legal issues at the mtg=
, and let Marlena and I work it through our attorney after this mtg.  This =
is my opinion, if Marlena feels differently, she can say so.

Thanks, look forward to the mtg.

Good Afternoon,

I would like to set up our next opportunity to discuss the implementation a=
nd process for proceeding with Class III Police Officers.  In speaking with=
 Chief Garofalo and Chief Armour we have tentatively held Tuesday, June 5th=
 from 10:30 - 12:30 for our next discussion.

Further, I believe we would be best suited to have both the township attorn=
ey (which I believe is the same firm) and the district attorney (Comegno La=
w Group) attend to review the contract and discuss the logistics of the nex=
t steps.  Rob, Guy, and I have shared draft contracts to assist in our disc=
ussion with the larger group.

I have reserved C110/C111 at the Board of Education Offices for the meeting=
.

It is probably also a good idea to have Greg and Joanne join us.  I didn't =
have their email addresses readily available.

Please let me know if you are able to join us.

Sincerely,

Dave
