Good Morning,

Sorry I didn't respond again last night...celebrating my 4 year olds birthday (youngest of five)

I have attached a few documents for your review.

The first is a document from Howell.  This was received after the draft agreement was put together an may offer additional language for consideration.

Then there is a draft agreement for WW and Plainsboro.  Identical except for names.

The fourth document is a budget document for district projected expenses.  There are two tabs on the bottom so the sub total must combine the two tabs (over 800K).  I have built in a lump sum for overtime (originally we discussed 13 officers...due to jurisdiction concerns I eliminated one officer going to 6 each with overtime rates in case of coverage needs).  Also, I built in a Sgt. Rate of 10K for oversight.  I know both forces have different command structures but I wanted to budget in some money to offset any management increase.

Lastly, I have included a draft resolution for WW and Plainsboro Townships modeled after the North Brunswick Township Resolution.

I have confirmed with Mark Toscano from Comegno that he is planning on attending.  Due to the amount of work needed to make this happen I believe we need to involve our attorneys right away to guide us through this process.

Sincerely,

Dave

Dave - that time and date works for me.   Can you please send Marlena and I the draft contracts to review prior to the mtg so we have the ability to converse at the 6/5 mtg.

I would prefer we make our way through the policy and financial matters first, then have the district attorney discuss the key legal issues at the mtg, and let Marlena and I work it through our attorney after this mtg.  This is my opinion, if Marlena feels differently, she can say so.

Thanks, look forward to the mtg.

Anthony

Good Afternoon,

I would like to set up our next opportunity to discuss the implementation and process for proceeding with Class III Police Officers.  In speaking with Chief Garofalo and Chief Armour we have tentatively held Tuesday, June 5th from 10:30 - 12:30 for our next discussion.

Further, I believe we would be best suited to have both the township attorney (which I believe is the same firm) and the district attorney (Comegno Law Group) attend to review the contract and discuss the logistics of the next steps.  Rob, Guy, and I have shared draft contracts to assist in our discussion with the larger group.

I have reserved C110/C111 at the Board of Education Offices for the meeting.

It is probably also a good idea to have Greg and Joanne join us.  I didn't have their email addresses readily available.

Please let me know if you are able to join us.

Sincerely,

Dave
