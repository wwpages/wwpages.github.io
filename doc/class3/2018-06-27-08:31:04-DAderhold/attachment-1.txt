Good Morning,

Last evening the WWP BOE voted 5-3 to support the Shared Service Agreement with both municipalities for Class III Officers.  The below three areas were fixed in the attached draft.  As you can see minor clarifications.

Pages 3-4

Section IV(G)(b).  Duties of SLEO III - can, may - which word should be used "can" or "may"?  May was identified and the word "can" was deleted.

Page 6

Sections VIII(F) & (G) -  fix left margin alignment. (Margins were fixed)

Page 7-8

Section VIII(I) - is blank. (This blank was removed)

I have attached the updated drafts.

Thanks for all your support.

Sincerely,

Dave
