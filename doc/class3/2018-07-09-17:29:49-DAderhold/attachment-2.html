 time and seeing reports of brutality and bias in the news everyday. Some kids may feel frightened by the presence of an armed police officer in the school. Especially when the news has a multiplicity of reports like this:</span><span style="font-size:9.0pt; color:black"></span></p>

 an unfortunate fact that students are exposed to the news coverage above, even though the vast majority of officers, particularly in our town, are well-trained and protect their communities and show respect to all people, regardless of race, sex, and gender.</span><span style="color:black">

 is the scope of our actual liability? Do the contract provisions themselves actually protect the town from liability? What happens if a police officer does something improper at the schools or is even just accused of doing something improper at the schools?
 The parent sues the schools and the Township because he is our employee. The schools pay the parents. The Township pays the parents. Then the Township pays the schools for their defense and anything they paid the parent. It is also possible and quite likely
 that the Joint Insurance Fund will disclaim coverage and that the taxpayers will pay. Negligent acts will be covered by insurance. It is the acts outside the scope of the officer's official duties that will not be covered and which are more likely to be the
 actions for which a parent will sue the school and the township. You, as the tax payer, will have paid twice if a liability claim is raised, once through the schools and once through the township indemnification clause. While they are two entities, the pocket
 is the same- yours. A portion of this may be covered by the Joint Insurance Fund but it is also likely that JIF could disclaim coverage because of what the officer did, i.e. if he assaults (or is claimed to have assaulted) a child it would be considered an
 intentional act and therefore, outside the scope of the Insurance coverage. Most insurance policies have exclusions for certain actions, usually disclaiming coverage for intentional acts. Why should the West Windsor and Plainsboro townships indemnify the actions
 of the officer? We, as a Township, did not ask for these additional officers in the schools, so why should we be asked to indemnify their actions? This liability should lie squarely with the School District since it is their plan initiated and designed by
 them. Take a closer look at the contract and see the clauses permitting these officers to transport our children because they will not be using police cars and will be driving private vehicle. Their vehicles will not be covered by the Joint Insurance Fund
 and we may not know what the coverage limits are since they will be privately insured. Further, if the SLEO III's job is to remain at the schools, why does the shared services agreement allow them to transport children? This contract does not protect the interests
 of our township and could potentially be the source of highly expensive lawsuits that are not covered by insurance. Does this make sense? What is wrong with the current system of the police officers being stationed outside the schools in their cars? Why is
 it necessary for them to be inside the schools given the legal and financial risks of them interacting with and transporting students?
