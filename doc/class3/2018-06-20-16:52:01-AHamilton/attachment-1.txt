Sorry-hit send too soon.

1.  What specifically will the police officers be doing in the schools.  The video from the SB presentation talks about fulfilling a counsellor function-what training have these officers received for that role?

2.  Detailed description of the type of training that the WWPD and/or school district will be providing to Class III officers to address issues of unconscious bias.  Will any kind of training be provided to address these issues and what will the scope of that training be?

I preface these questions with the following statement:

I am extremely supportive of our police department and am not opposed to having armed police officers in the schools.  My concern stems from two areas-what will these officers be asked to do in the schools and how will these officers be trained for their new role of interacting with children on a daily basis.

2.Please provide me with a detailed description of the type of training that the WWPD and/or the school district will be providing to any Class III officer or employee hired by the WWPD.
