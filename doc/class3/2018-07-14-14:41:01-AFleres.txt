Mr. Hinsdale,

Concerning your request for a response to the interactions among elected me=
mbers of the West Windsor Township government, speaking for the WW-P Board =
of Education, it would be inappropriate to comment. Further, there is no ma=
tter before the board of education for us to enable or inhibit.

Separately, I would like to clarify the events. At the June 11 WW Council m=
eeting, it was decided to invite Dr. Aderhold to a subsequent meeting to di=
scuss the use of Class III officers in WW-P schools. It was also agreed tha=
t council members would send any questions they may have on the Shared Serv=
ices Agreement to Dr. Aderhold, so he could be better prepared to respond t=
o them. I assume you would agree that this was a reasonable course of actio=
n.

As Dr. Aderhold stated in his June 22 email to the council members, to save=
 time at the meeting, he was attaching written responses to a number of the=
ir questions but felt some could be better answered during the presentation=
. As I recall the June 25 meeting, Ms. Hamilton=92s concerns were discussed=
 by both Dr. Aderhold and Lt. Lee. Since the original intent was to address=
 all of the questions on Monday, for you to characterize =93to be discussed=
 on Monday=94 as being nonresponsive was simply wrong and misleading.


To quote one of my earlier emails to you, =93the issue of school security a=
nd student safety is a complicated and, currently an emotionally-charged to=
pic, with groups of well-meaning individuals offering different, sometimes =
conflicting, solutions.=94 Going forward, let=92s assume that all parties, =
especially those we don=92t agree with, are at least acting in good faith.

Subject: Re: June 27, 2018 Discussion of Class III issue on Facebook

Hi all,

I'd like to follow up on my FYI Email below from two Fridays ago (6/29) abo=
ut the harshly and unfairly critical online post from the Mayor of 6/27.  L=
ast time I wrote:

> This Email is for your information only.  It is not a complaint or any ot=
her kind of request for action and response is entirely optional.

This time it is a complaint and I am requesting a response (from the School=
 District).

I call your attention to a comment from the Mayor, in the middle of page 8 =
(discussion is attached again for your convenience):

Comment from Hemant Marathe at June 27, 2018, 5:19pm
"Ayesha Krishnan Hamilton as a council women ... You were offered an opport=
unity to comment on the agreement twice in writing and not a single comment=
 was received from you."

To date I had taken the basis for this criticism to be credible, but it now=
 appears actually to have been made up by the Mayor, something I'm now used=
 to.  However in this case the School District appears also to have contrib=
uted to the circumstances that allow this, and this is a real problem for m=
e.

Today I received, by way of a response to an OPRA document request, an Emai=
l Q&A between the Township and District preceding the 6/25 Council meeting.=
  The 6/25 meeting was the one where Superintendent Aderhold spoke, and at =
which Council had yet more Q&A about the Class III program.

I've attached that here as two files, Dr. Aderhold's 6/22 Email and its Q&A=
 attachment.  At the very end of the Q&A from WW Council, is the District's=
 (non-)response to the inquiry about bias training:

[Q. from Hamilton]
"2. Detailed description of the type of training that the WWPD and/or schoo=
l district will be providing to Class III officers to address issues of unc=
onscious bias. Will any kind of training be provided to address these issue=
s and what will the scope of that training be?"

And the (non-)response from the District:
"To be discussed on Monday." [i.e., 6/25/18 Council meeting]

As the Mayor was included in this pre-meeting Q&A discussion there is no po=
ssible basis for his criticism of the Council member's waiting until the me=
eting to pose her question: it was simply not answered at all in advance by=
 the District.

Again, I am used to this kind of thing from the Mayor, but I cannot tolerat=
e its enablement by the District, to whose care I entrust my kids every day=
.  I need a bit more rectitude in that arena.

I would like some response from someone in the District (I don't care who, =
any Board member, Superintendent, etc.) as to what you think of this, and w=
hether you think it is OK.  If I don't hear back I am going to assume you a=
re all OK with this.  I hope it is clear why this is a problem.

I am making this request not as a WW taxpayer but as a parent with kids in =
the WW-P schools.

Looking forward to hearing back,

        John Hinsdale
