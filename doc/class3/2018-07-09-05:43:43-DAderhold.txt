FYI

Posted this morning on Facebook by Tony Fleres, BOE President

Recent posts here concerning the use of Special Law Enforcement Officers - =
Class III (SLEO III) in our schools are revealing many misconceptions of th=
e purpose, roles and motivation behind what is being proposed.

I strongly urge anyone interested to watch the video of the May 8, 2018, pr=
esentation to the BOE for yourself, so you can form your own opinion rather=
 they rely on what others are saying.

Concerning the purpose, first, there is the obvious improvement in security=
 that comes with having police officer already present on school grounds wh=
o is familiar with the building and its operations in the event of an extre=
me emergency. Beyond any catastrophic event, which admittedly has a low (bu=
t not zero) probability of happening, the officers will be available to ass=
ist in traditional functions where a regular on-duty officer would normally=
 be called, leaving that officer free to attend to his or her normal assign=
ment. Also, while threat assessment, response time, and deterrence are prim=
ary functions, community policing and relationship building are additional =
benefits.

In the schools, the roles and powers of the SLEO III officers will be no di=
fferent than the regular full-time police officers. They are spelled out in=
 the state-mandated Memorandum of Agreement Between Education and Law Enfor=
cement already in place. The hiring of SLEO III officers will not in any wa=
y change the job descriptions of building principals and assistant principa=
ls. Disciplinary action will continue to be done by school administration. =
They will not be involved with student discipline except in cases where the=
 law already requires be law enforcement be involved.

I admit that whether the benefits justify the officers' presence is a judgm=
ent call. The BOE vote was 5-3 in favor, with one of the no votes saying sh=
e agreed with having officers at the upper grades, but thought they were un=
necessary in the elementary schools.

As I said at the last BOE meeting, reasonable people can disagree. However,=
 in the ensuing public discussion a number of false statements have been ma=
de, some by people who should know better, that I feel need to be clarified=
 for the record.

First, there seems to be an impression going around that these officers wil=
l be patrolling the halls looking for ways to harass students and ready to =
handcuff anyone found without a hall pass. Statements like "We have a drug =
problem in our schools and the Administration is trying to use police offic=
ers to fix it" or references to a "school to prison pipeline" in WW-P show =
a complete lack of understanding of what happens in our schools today. And =
frankly, they are insulting to the school staff and police departments who =
work hard to protect, educate and support the children of our community eve=
ry day.

Similarly, comments made about the officers possibly acting as informal cou=
nselors, show that many do not understand what the word "informal" means. I=
t is hoped these officers will be seen by students as an adult they can go =
to for advice, like a respected coach or teacher.

There was also a concern about adequate training. The Board of Education va=
lues professional development and training for all its staff and will work =
with the police chiefs to ensure their officers continue to receive appropr=
iate training. The budget established by the school district includes funds=
 for initial and ongoing training the SLEO III officers. And keep in mind t=
hat these officers will be recently retired NJ police officers, meaning tha=
t they will come 20 plus years of experience. In addition, both police chie=
fs assured us that the quality of their departments will not be compromised=
.

People have questioned the timing of the process with votes scheduled for t=
he summer when people are away. Actually, public discussion began in early =
March when the 2018-2019 budget was being prepared. In March there were eve=
n discussion threads on this Facebook site about the proposal for SLEO IIIs=
. A public presentation was made at the May 8 board of education meeting, v=
ideo posted on the district website and played on each townships cable chan=
nel, and an article was published in a May issue of the WW&P News. Follow u=
p discussions were had at each meeting up to the June 26 BOE vote. If the B=
OE was trying to sneak the past people, we were doing a very poor job of it=
.

Again, this is subject where reasonable people can disagree. I don=92t mind=
 debate, but some of the statements made show an unsettling amount of distr=
ust for our fine police departments and school administrators. One of the g=
oals of the program is establishing a better relationship between the publi=
c and the police. As good as our two Police Departments are, it seems they =
have their work cut out for them.

If anyone has any questions or comments for me, my email address is Anthony=
.Fleres@ww-p.org<mailto:Anthony.Fleres@ww-p.org>.
