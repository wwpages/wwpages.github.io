Subject: West Windsor Township Meeting 7/30

Good Evening,

I am writing to you as a concerned mother of an active second grader in WWP=
 schools, and a 3 year old who would possibly attend in a few years.  I do =
not want additional armed police officers in our schools.  I would attend t=
he meeting on 7/30 and express my opposition there, however I'm out of town=
 with family.  If the council rejects, my understanding is the decision wou=
ld go back to the BOE and parents opposed to this solution will have more o=
f an opportunity to express our opinions to the BOE.  There have been sever=
al social media posts from the Mayor's office worded like the office is att=
empting to shut down communication, which is disheartening.

My request is not coming from a lack of faith in our police department - I =
have the utmost respect for and trust in our officers.  I feel to better pr=
otect our children we need a balance of mental health support in addition t=
o security.  Our high schoolers especially have an immediate need for addit=
ional mental health and counselor support, where I've read we have had repe=
at issues of depression, and suicide threats.

I don't work in a building with an armed security guard, my daughter's dayc=
are does not have armed security.  My son's elementary school does not need=
 it, either.  There are other ways to create a secure building.  I feel the=
 money is better used towards mental health screening and support, and I ha=
ve no opposition to additional unarmed security.  I feel our community also=
 deserves more information and opportunities to ask questions about this ch=
ange in a non-hostile atmosphere with open dialogue, at hours of the day/we=
ek where most working parents are available to attend.

What training will the active/retired officers have, and what support would=
 they receive?  The Parkland security officer failed to help that situation=
 - when was the last time he was evaluated or had a mental health screening=
?  Retired officers would be coming back into the workforce from years of e=
xposure in a high-stress job, how would they be initially screened and then=
 what kind of ongoing support would they receive, and how often would they =
be evaluated on an ongoing basis?

A balance of additional services to students and existing / proposed staff =
is just as important (in my opinion more important) as evaluating security =
needs.

Again, I work in a secure but unarmed local building, as do many people.  I=
 don't see the need for armed guards in our schools and I wasn't aware of t=
his earlier BOE vote or I would have voiced my opinion at that time.

Thank you for your time and for listening to my opinion on this matter.

Sincerely,



Eilleen Cardone
