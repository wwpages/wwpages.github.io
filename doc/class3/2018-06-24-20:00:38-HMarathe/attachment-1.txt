David,

I have read the responses and printing them. I will highlight some. This gives me an opportunity to answer some of the questions / concerns raised by the respondents.

Text/call when you get out of your meeting in Plainsboro and we will meet briefly tomorrow afternoon. 

Thanks

Hemant

Dear Board Members and District Administration,

As you may be aware, the African American Parent Support Group (AAPSG) of West Windsor-Plainsboro shared information with the community regarding the WW-P District proposal to introduce and deploy Class 3 School Resource Officers at our schools.  Additionally, a 4 question online survey (6/8-6/22/18) offered the opportunity to provide feedback.  The information shared and the survey can be found at: WW-P CLASS III SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS (SROs) INFO & SURVEY<https://wwpaapsg.weebly.com/school-resource-officers-survey.html>.    The "unedited" responses to the survey (as of 6/22/18) are accessible from the survey page (via link to PDF) or PDF links directly at: WW-P CLASS III SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS (SROs) â€‹SURVEY RESPONSES<https://wwpaapsg.weebly.com/8203ww-p-class-iii-school-resource-officers-sros-survey-responses.html>.  We offer the survey responses as input for your process and decision making, and are not providing an opinion of AAPSG.

Please note that the survey was conducted with anonymity (no names requested). While the constituents (open to public) taking the survey are not specifically known, nor were there limits to anyone taking the survey multiple times, many of the comments, concerns and questions raised on the topic may still be relevant towards providing an opportunity for a thoughtful and well informed dialogue with the community.

The survey is still open and we will share additional responses for your consideration as you move forward towards making the best decisions and action plans for securing safety at our schools.

As always, if we may assist you or answer any questions regarding the survey, please contact us.

Best regards,
