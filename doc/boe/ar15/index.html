    <h2>NJ Board of Ed. Told of Scholarship Funded by AR-15 Gun Raffle</h2>

    <i>This web page contains only material that is a matter of public record, and nothing else.</i>

    <p/>

    The Board of Education of West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District ("WW-P"), based in West Windsor, New Jersey, were informed in late 2021 of a local organization, also based in that town, offering a High School scholarship, funded in part by the sale (raffle) of an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle.  In the Spring of 2022, WW-P were further informed that the scholarship was promoted by the District to High School students, without disclosing to them that the proceeds of the AR-15 served to fund the scholarship.

    <p/>

    Neither the rifle donor nor the raffle winner were from West Windsor, nor anywhere else in Mercer County.  The assault rifle was donated by Cheyenne Mountain Outfitters of Bordentown (Burlington County), NJ.  The winner of the raffle, who presumably took receipt of the gun, was Erik Bellish of Florence Township (Burlington County), NJ.

Subject: High School Scholarship funding via police raffle of AR-15 semi-automatic rifle

<p/>    

Dear Members of the Board and Dr. Aderhold,

<p/>    

I'm emailing you all with the information below in the event it might be of interest or use to you.  This is not a complaint or any other kind of request for response or action.  You may consider reading or responding to this Email optional.  I will likely read and might respond to any replies, but I can't make any guarantees.  This email is not an invitation or promise for any followup discussion by me with anyone, and, notwithstanding the absence of any reason to believe you would do so, I ask that you not treat or misrepresent it as such an invitation or promise.

<p/>    

On Memorial Day of this year, May 31, 2021, the West Windsor Policemen's Benevolent Association (PBA) raffled off a Smith & Wesson model M&P ("Military & Police") 15 Sport rifle, with advance advertising of the raffle on Facebook in this March 6, 2021 post [1] which read in entirety:

<blockquote>
<i>
"Going twice....West Windsor PBA #271 is having a fundraiser raffle for your chance to win a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 Sport Rifle. All proceeds benefit the numerous local, state and nation wide charities we regularly donate to, along with our High School Scholarship program. $20 donation for your chance to win! Must have a valid NJ Firearms ID card and pass all required background checks to redeem the prize. Thank you to Cheyenne Mountain Outfitters for sponsoring the raffle. Accepting cash or Venmo (@west-windsor) just put gun raffle as subject."
</i>
</blockquote>

<p/>

Among the uses for the funding cited was the "High School Scholarship program."  The raffle drawing took place on Memorial Day [2].  The model of rifle raffled off was Smith & Wesson's version of the AR-15 semiautomatic design [3], presumably modified for compliance in New Jersey.

<p/>

As it happens, this was the same Smith & Wesson M&P 15 model (likely without the modifications) that 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse used in Kenosha, WI in August, 2020 [4], nine months before the West Windsor PBA conducted the raffle drawing.

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: High School Scholarship funding via police raffle of AR-15 semi-automatic rifle

<p/>    

Hello, this is to follow up on my Email of Nov. 22, 2021 to the Board as it was then formed, and is being sent to the Board as since reorganized.  The original Email, including attachments, is below and new Board members are invited to consider it part of this one.  I'm emailing you all with the information below in the event it might be of interest or use to you.  This is not a complaint or any other kind of request for response or action.  You may consider reading or responding to this Email optional.  I will likely read and might respond to any replies, but I can't make any guarantees.  This email is not an invitation or promise for any followup discussion by me with anyone, and, notwithstanding the absence of any reason to believe you would do so, I ask that you not treat or misrepresent it as such an invitation or promise.  This Email is sent in my capacity as a West Windsor taxpayer and from no other perspective.  Replies (or portions thereof) beyond this limited scope will be confirmed as ignored.

<p/>    

When I wrote the Board last November about the West Windsor PBA #271 High School Scholarship being funded by the raffle of an AR-15 class semi-automatic assault rifle, I was unsure as to whether the West Windsor-Plainsboro District was involved in any way with this fundraising and awarding, and indeed whether the District was even aware of it until I Emailed you all about it.

<p/>    

It has since come to my attention through a reliable source [1] that the District advertised this scholarship to students, and did so being fully aware since last November of its being funded by the raffle (i.e. sale) of the AR-15 assault rifle, and without disclosing this source of funding for the scholarship to potential recipients.

<p/>    

Beyond putting this on the public record with this Email, It's my intention to share widely the details of this scholarship and District's involvement with it, and any other related public information.  This would include not only the local community, but with Moms Demand Action and other organizations, and members of the press, e.g. NJ.COM, Star Ledger, NY Times, etc.  These intentions are being provided for your information, as a courtesy, should these people come seeking comment on all this from the District.

<p/>    

Sincerely,

<p/>
